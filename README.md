# Earthquake Visualization

This is my earthquake visualization using d3.js.

## Installation

In order to use the mapbox static api, you need to get a free public access key. The one in this repo and on the heroku site are changed frequently by yours truly.  

You will also need to get your own earthquake data. I got it from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database). Signing up is free. The little python script in the python directory deletes unused fields.

To install dependencies run:

`npm install`

To build:

`npm run build`

You must have babel set up on your machine

To serve:

`npm run serve`
